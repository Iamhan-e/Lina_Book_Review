## Review

I recently finished The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides, and it’s a gripping psychological thriller that kept me hooked for most of the journey. The story follows Alicia Berenson, a famous painter who shoots her husband and then goes mute, refusing to explain her actions. Theo Faber, a psychotherapist with his own troubled past, becomes obsessed with uncovering why she did it, taking a job at the psychiatric facility where she’s held.

The setup is instantly intriguing, pulling you into Alicia’s mysterious silence and Theo’s determination to break it. Michaelides does a fantastic job weaving suspense through short, punchy chapters and diary entries that offer glimpses into Alicia’s mind. The Greek mythology references, especially to Alcestis, add a layer of depth that I enjoyed, making the story feel both tragic and artistic. The pacing is steady, building tension toward a twist that caught me off guard—I had to reread the final pages to make sure I got it right!

That said, the book isn’t flawless. Some side characters felt a bit flat, and there were moments where Theo’s actions stretched believability, especially for a therapist. A few plot threads felt like red herrings that didn’t fully resolve, which left me wanting a bit more closure. Still, the twist and the psychological depth of the main characters made up for these quibbles.

Overall, The Silent Patient is a compelling read for anyone who loves a smart thriller with a surprising payoff. It’s not perfect, but it’s darn close, and I’d recommend it to fans of the genre.
