## Review

The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang is an absolute masterpiece of fantasy that hits every mark with its bold storytelling and unflinching depth. The story follows Rin, a war orphan from a poor province, who claws her way into an elite military academy through a grueling empire-wide exam. As she uncovers her rare shamanic powers, she’s thrust into a brutal war inspired by 20th-century Chinese history, blending political intrigue, mythology, and raw emotion.

Kuang’s writing is phenomenal—vivid, immersive, and perfectly paced. Rin is an unforgettable protagonist: fierce, flawed, and relentlessly driven, her journey from underdog to a force of nature is both inspiring and gut-wrenching. The world-building is breathtaking, with a richly detailed magic system and a setting that feels alive with culture, strategy, and the devastating realities of war. The way Kuang weaves historical parallels with fantasy elements is seamless, and the story’s intensity builds to a crescendo of haunting, unforgettable moments that left me floored.

Even the supporting characters shine, and the moral complexity of Rin’s choices keeps you hooked. If there’s any critique, it’s that the graphic depictions of violence might be intense for some, but they serve the story’s unflinching honesty.

The Poppy War is a perfect 5/5 read. It’s a dark, epic, and brilliantly crafted fantasy that’s ideal for anyone who loves complex characters, rich world-building, and stories that don’t shy away from tough truths. A must-read for fantasy fans!
