author: "V.E. Schwab"
cover: "/vicious.jpg"
summary: "Vicious by V.E. Schwab is a dark fantasy novel that subverts the traditional superhero genre. It follows two brilliant and arrogant college roommates, Victor Vale and Eli Ever, who become obsessed with the idea of ExtraOrdinaries, or EOsâ€”people with superhuman abilities. They discover that these powers are born from near-death experiences.When they experiment on themselves, things go horribly wrong. Ten years later, their friendship has soured into a deadly rivalry. Eli, now a public hero with the power of self-healing, is on a self-proclaimed crusade to hunt down and kill every other EO, believing them to be an abomination. Victor, having escaped from prison, is determined to find and kill Eli in a quest for revenge.The story is a morally gray tale of revenge and power, where neither character is a clear hero or villain. They are both driven by their past and their twisted sense of justice, and their paths are set for a final, violent confrontation."

## Review

**Vicious** by V.E. Schwab is a super fun twist on the superhero story. It's not about good guys in capes fighting bad guys. Instead, it's about two brilliant but arrogant college guys, Victor and Eli, who figure out how to get superpowers. But when they try it, everything goes wrong and their friendship turns into a deadly rivalry.

Ten years later, Eli is this famous hero who's secretly hunting and killing other super-powered people, believing they're all evil. Meanwhile, Victor, who's just broken out of prison, is out for revenge. The whole book is a dark, action-packed ride, and you're never quite sure who you should be rooting for. It's a great read if you're into something a little different from your typical superhero fare.
