## Review
Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir is a thrilling sci-fi adventure that hooked me with its mix of humor, science, and heart. The story follows Ryland Grace, a former school teacher turned astronaut, who wakes up alone on a spaceship with no memory of who he is or why he’s there. As his memories trickle back, he learns he’s on a desperate mission to save Earth from a star-eating microbe threatening a new ice age.

Weir’s writing is sharp and engaging, packed with accessible science that makes you feel like you’re solving problems alongside Ryland. The nonlinear narrative, flipping between his present predicament and past events, keeps the suspense high and the stakes even higher. The humor—Ryland’s witty, nerdy voice—had me chuckling, especially in tense moments, and the unexpected friendships (no spoilers!) add a surprising emotional depth. The plot’s twists are clever, and the science feels plausible, even when it stretches into speculative territory.

That said, it’s not perfect. The pacing can feel uneven, with some scientific explanations dragging a bit, especially if you’re not a physics buff. A few supporting characters in the flashbacks come off as flat, and the ending, while satisfying, felt a touch rushed compared to the buildup.

Project Hail Mary is a solid 3/5 read. It’s a fun, smart, and heartfelt sci-fi journey that’s perfect for fans of The Martian or anyone who loves a good mix of brainy problem-solving and emotional stakes. Definitely a book that’ll stick with you!
