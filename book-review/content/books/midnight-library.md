summary: "Nora Seed, a woman overwhelmed by regret and despair, finds herself at the edge of life after a suicide attempt. Instead of death, she arrives in the Midnight Library, a mystical place between life and death, where each book represents a different version of her life based on choices she could have made. Guided by Mrs. Elm, her childhood librarian, Nora explores alternate lives—where she’s a rock star, an Olympian, a mother, or a glaciologist—each revealing joys and challenges. As she navigates these parallel realities, Nora learns that no life is perfect, and small changes in perspective or choices can profoundly impact her sense of fulfillment. Ultimately, the novel conveys a message of hope, self-acceptance, and the value of embracing the imperfect beauty of one’s own life, encouraging readers to find meaning in their existing choices rather than dwelling on what ifs."

## Review
The Midnight Library by Matt Haig is a really engaging and heartfelt read! It follows Nora Seed, who’s feeling lost and stuck in life, until she finds herself in a magical library between life and death. Each book in this library lets her step into a different version of her life, exploring all the “what ifs” she’s been wondering about.

Haig’s writing is warm and approachable, weaving big ideas about life and choices into a story that keeps you turning pages. Nora’s such a relatable character—you really feel for her as she navigates her regrets and tries out these alternate lives. The library concept is super creative, and it sparks some deep thoughts about the choices we make and what makes life meaningful. The emotional moments hit home, and the hopeful vibe of the story is uplifting without feeling forced.

That said, it’s not quite perfect. A few of the alternate lives feel a bit underdeveloped, like they could’ve used more depth to really shine. The pacing also dips a little in the middle with some repetitive bits. But the story pulls through, and the ending wraps things up in a way that feels satisfying and genuine.

The Midnight Library is a strong 4/5 read. It’s a touching, imaginative story that’s great for anyone who enjoys books that make you reflect on life with a sprinkle of magic. Definitely worth picking up!
